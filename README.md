# Django
- We start by building a virtual environment
- Followed with the setting up of basic python files
- we then add the interactive environment of Django Shell
- This is then followed by building templates and other pages which will be linked to the home page
- Lastly, to make the program more attractve we use bootstap styles to design the platform and connect it with an official HTTP for others to use it.
